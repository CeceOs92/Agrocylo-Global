 * Rolling-window 5xx rate monitor (Issue #756). A single slow endpoint or a
 * flaky downstream dependency can produce a handful of 500s under totally
 * normal operation — alerting on every one would be noise a human tunes out
 * within a day. This only fires when the rate crosses a threshold within a
 * short window, and only once per cooldown period, so it's reserved for
 * "something is actually degraded right now" rather than background noise.
