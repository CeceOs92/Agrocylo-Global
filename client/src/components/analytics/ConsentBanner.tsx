 * First-load analytics consent banner.
 *
 * Distinct from `components/onboarding/LocationConsent.tsx`, which only
 * covers geolocation sharing. This banner governs general analytics
 * tracking (`src/lib/analytics.ts`) and is the only UI that can move
 * `consentState` out of its default "unknown" state.
 *
 * Renders only while consent is "unknown" (i.e. no choice has been
 * persisted yet). Once the user grants or denies, `setConsent` persists
 * the choice via `setAnalyticsConsent`/`loadConsent` in the analytics lib
 * and the banner disappears for good (until storage is cleared).
